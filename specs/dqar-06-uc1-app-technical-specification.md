# UC1 Assessment App — Technical Specification
**Digital Measure Readiness Assessment Application**
*Version: June 2026 | For Claude Code + Health Samurai Implementation*

---

## Overview

This document specifies the technical architecture for the UC1 Digital Measure Readiness Assessment application. This application is the technical implementation of one tenet of the broader Digital Quality Audit Readiness (DQAR) — specifically Domain 6 (ECDS and dQM readiness) with elements of Domain 2 (value set conformance) and Domain 3 (data lineage tracing).

**Framework linkage:** This app implements UC1 of the DQAR use case index (`dqar-03-use-case-index.md`). The full DQAR framework, six audit domains, three-tier findings structure, regulatory timeline, and partner guides live in the DQAR Shared KB project. This application does not implement the full framework — it implements the technical pipeline that powers UC1 assessment engagements.

**Partners:** Health Samurai (Aidbox + Termbox), Sonian (pipeline, query library, findings report)

---

## Architecture Summary

The pipeline has six stages. Stage 1 (with substages 1a, 1a2, 1b, 1c) executes entirely in the client environment against PHI-containing data. Stage 2 (PHI redaction) is optional and client-initiated. Stages 3–6 execute in the Sonian or plan-owned Aidbox environment.

```
CLIENT ENVIRONMENT (PHI present)

  Stage 1:   Bulk FHIR Export and Conformance Testing
             The client's IT team runs the conformance testing kit against their
             FHIR vendor extract. Four substages run in sequence, orchestrated
             by orchestrate.py.
             All PHI stays within the client environment.
             Outputs: one combined JSON report + one combined HTML report
             (rolled up from the per-substage JSON files below).

    Stage 1a: Bulk FHIR API conformance    [stage1a_bulk_fhir_export_preflight.py]
              CapabilityStatement query · $export kick-off · manifest
              conformance check · output content-type check against Bulk Data
              Access IG STU2. Runs against the live FHIR vendor server.
              Skipped if $export not declared in CapabilityStatement.
              Output: stage1a-{engagement}.json

    Stage 1a2: Bulk FHIR extract packaging conformance  [stage1a2_bulk_fhir_extract_preflight.py]
              Extract not empty · Patient.ndjson present · HEDIS core types
              present (Condition, Observation, Encounter) · medication data
              present · single resource type per file.
              Runs against the exported ndjson files. Skipped if no ndjson
              files are present.
              Output: stage1a2-{engagement}.json

    Stage 1b: ndjson structural conformance testing  [stage1b_ndjson_validator.py]
              Parseable JSON · resourceType present · one resource per
              line · UTF-8 encoding · resourceType matches filename stem
              (Patient.ndjson must contain only Patient resources).
              Runs against the exported ndjson files.
              Output: stage1b-{engagement}.json

    Stage 1c: FHIR R4 + US Core conformance [stage1c_fhir_uscore_validator.py]
              1c-i  — Base FHIR R4 (4.0.1) structural conformance testing (no IG)
              1c-ii — US Core 6.1.0 profile conformance testing
              --backend hapi-cli (default): HAPI Validator CLI, no server needed (Rung 1/2)
                --tx-mode local (default): no terminology server connection,
                  structure/profile checks only
                --tx-mode live: connects to tx.fhir.org for full terminology
                  binding validation, ~20% slower
              --backend aidbox: Aidbox $validate REST API, engagement config required (Rung 3+)
              Output: stage1c-i-{engagement}.json + stage1c-ii-{engagement}.json

  → Client receives one combined JSON report + one combined HTML report.
  → Client decision point — three paths forward:

  PATH A — Stop here (no data leaves the plan)
            Act on findings using internal staff or Sonian advisory.
            No sandbox, no PHI redaction, no vendor contracts needed.
            Full value from Stage 1 findings at Rung 1.

  PATH B — Proceed to sandbox (anonymized extract only)
            Client runs Stage 2 PHI redaction locally, sends
            anonymized extract to Sonian Aidbox sandbox.
            Deeper validation: Termbox VSD conformance, AuditEvent
            metadata, SQL on FHIR queries, full three-tier findings
            report. No PHI crosses the boundary.
            Appropriate while HS HIPAA/SOC2 due diligence is in progress.

  PATH C — Full platform operational mode (PHI in Aidbox)
            After plan completes Health Samurai HIPAA BAA and SOC2
            review and contracts Aidbox, the Bulk FHIR extract loads
            directly to the plan's own Aidbox instance with full PHI.
            No anonymization step. Stage 1 becomes the pre-ingest
            quality gate for real operations.
            AuditEvent metadata captures lineage from day one.
            This is the target state — the platform ladder destination.

  Stage 2:  PHI redaction + anonymization   [PATH B ONLY — client-initiated]
            NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — stage2/ is currently an empty package;
            docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.uc3.yml, and
            config/anonymization.yaml referenced below are planned, not
            present in the repo yet.
            Target design: client runs local redaction against the Bulk
            FHIR extract via the Docker Compose stack (docker/), producing
            anonymized, compressed ndjson (.ndjson.gz) — no
            member-identifiable fields.
            Not required for Path A or Path C.
            Output: anonymized .ndjson.gz extract ready for Sonian delivery.

PHI BOUNDARY — PATH B ONLY
  Anonymized extract + Stage 1 reports cross to Sonian.
  Path C bypasses this boundary entirely — PHI loads directly
  to the plan's own contracted Aidbox instance.

SONIAN ENVIRONMENT — PATH B (anonymized sandbox)

  Stage 3:  Load to Aidbox sandbox
            (a) Re-run Stage 1b + 1c conformance testing on anonymized extract
                → confirms redaction did not corrupt structural integrity
                → creates permanent conformance baseline for this extract
            (b) Termbox $validate-code — US Core required bindings
                + HEDIS MP2025 VSD (369 value sets)
            (c) AuditEvent + seven extensions generated atomically per resource

  Stage 4:  DQAR SQL on FHIR assessment queries
            Five-measure SQL on FHIR ViewDefinition library.
            Risk stratification matrix from AuditEvent metadata.
            Measure attribution join queries.

  Stage 5:  Three-tier findings report generation
            Tier 1 — Governance gaps
            Tier 2 — Measure data gaps
            Tier 3 — Digital readiness gaps
            Each finding: technical severity + governance root cause
            + DAMA-DMBOK maturity score + remediation recommendation.

PLAN'S OWN AIDBOX INSTANCE — PATH C (full PHI operational mode)

  Stage 3:  Load to plan-contracted Aidbox instance (with PHI)
            Same pattern as Path B sandbox — Stage 1b + 1c re-run
            at ingest, Termbox VSD, AuditEvent seven extensions.
            This is real operations, not assessment.
            AuditEvent metadata is permanent production lineage.

  Stage 4+: Ongoing UC2 monitoring cadence applies.
            Sonian runs assessment queries against plan's Aidbox
            on scheduled cadence under $4K/month retainer.
```

## Client-Side Conformance Testing Kit (Stage 1 — Substages 1a, 1a2, 1b, 1c)

### Deliverable to client at engagement kickoff

Sonian provides a conformance testing kit the client's IT team runs on their own infrastructure against raw PHI-containing ndjson. No PHI leaves the client environment. `orchestrate.py` sequences all substages and produces one combined JSON report and one combined HTML report (no PDF rendering). The client decides independently whether to proceed to the optional PHI redaction (Stage 2) and Sonian sandbox (Stage 3) stages.

The kit supports two validator backends for Stages 1b and 1c:
- **HAPI Validator CLI** — default, no vendor contract required, runs anywhere Java is available (Rung 1 and Rung 2)
- **Aidbox** — available at Rung 3+ when the plan has Aidbox in production; provides native conformance testing at write time with richer error metadata

### Stage 1a — Bulk FHIR API conformance  `stage1a_bulk_fhir_export_preflight.py`

Tests the plan's FHIR server `$export` implementation live against the SMART Bulk Data Access IG STU2 before any data is exported. Six checks: CapabilityStatement declares `$export`, kick-off returns 202 Accepted, Content-Location header present, polling completes with 200, manifest contains `output[]` and `requiresAccessToken`, output files return `application/fhir+ndjson` content-type.

Skipped automatically if preflight reports `bulk_export_supported: false`.

Output: `stage1a-{engagement}.json`

### Stage 1a2 — Bulk FHIR extract packaging conformance  `stage1a2_bulk_fhir_extract_preflight.py`

Verifies the ndjson file set constitutes a well-formed Bulk FHIR extract suitable for digital quality assessment: extract not empty, `Patient.ndjson` present (denominator population), HEDIS core types present (Condition, Observation, Encounter), medication data present (MedicationRequest or MedicationDispense), single resource type per file. Does not re-validate JSON structure — that is Stage 1b's responsibility. Library-only (no standalone CLI); invoked by `orchestrate.py` and the web app. Skipped if no ndjson files are present.

Output: `stage1a2-{engagement}.json`

### Stage 1b — ndjson structural conformance testing  `stage1b_ndjson_validator.py`

Validates every line of every ndjson file in the Bulk FHIR export: parseable JSON, `resourceType` present, one resource per line. Runs against raw PHI-containing export output. No PHI in the output report — aggregate counts and error descriptions only.

Output: `stage1b-{engagement}.json`

### Stage 1c — FHIR R4 + US Core conformance  `stage1c_fhir_uscore_validator.py`

Two sub-passes:

```bash
# Rung 1/2 — HAPI Validator CLI (default, no FHIR server required)
python stage1c_fhir_uscore_validator.py \
  --ndjson-dir data/export \
  --engagement client-name \
  --backend hapi-cli \
  --validator-jar tools/validator_cli.jar \
  --tx-mode local

# Rung 3+ — Aidbox $validate REST API (engagement config required)
python stage1c_fhir_uscore_validator.py \
  --ndjson-dir data/export \
  --engagement config/engagements/client.json \
  --backend aidbox
```

Both produce identical output files:
- `stage1c-i-{engagement}.json` — base FHIR R4 results
- `stage1c-ii-{engagement}.json` — US Core 6.1.0 results

For `--backend hapi-cli`, sub-passes run sequentially via the HAPI Validator CLI JAR (set `FHIR_VALIDATOR_JAR` env var or pass `--validator-jar`). Both `--tx-mode` values resolve FHIR R4 + US Core 6.1.0 + terminology dependency packages (`hl7.terminology.r4`, `us.nlm.vsac`, `us.cdc.phinvads`; ~940MB) from a pinned, project-local cache (`.fhir-cache/`, gitignored) rather than the developer's home directory, so structural/profile validation behavior is identical across machines and CI. The cache is warmed once during the Docker image build (`RUN python tools/provision_fhir_cache.py`) or restored from a CI cache step — not regenerated per test run. `--tx-mode` only controls whether the validator *additionally* connects out to a terminology server for binding validation: `local` (default) passes `-tx n/a` — no outbound connection, terminology binding checks are skipped, structure/profile checks still run against the local cache — while `live` connects to `tx.fhir.org` for full terminology binding validation on top of the same structure/profile checks (~20% slower). For `--backend aidbox`, each resource is POSTed to `{base_url}/fhir/{ResourceType}/$validate` and OperationOutcome issues are classified into 1c-i (base FHIR R4) or 1c-ii (US Core) based on whether a US Core profile URL appears in the issue diagnostics. The `--engagement` argument must be a path to an engagement config JSON when using `--backend aidbox`.

### Conformance report format (delivered to Sonian — no PHI)

```json
{
  "report_type": "fhir-conformance",
  "stage": "1c-ii",
  "validator": "hapi-cli",
  "validator_version": "6.3.x",
  "tx_mode": "local",
  "terminology_binding_validation": "skipped (local tx-mode — no terminology server connection)",
  "ig_version": "hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0",
  "us_core_version": "6.1.0",
  "fhir_version": "4.0.1",
  "engagement": "client-name",
  "run_timestamp": "2025-10-14T09:00:00Z",
  "summary": {
    "total_resources": 48230,
    "error_count": 847,
    "warning_count": 2341,
    "information_count": 5102
  },
  "by_resource_type": [
    {
      "resource_type": "Condition",
      "total": 12440,
      "errors": 234,
      "warnings": 891,
      "top_errors": [
        {"code": "MUST_SUPPORT", "element": "Condition.clinicalStatus", "count": 189},
        {"code": "BINDING", "element": "Condition.code", "count": 45}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Field notes: `"validator"` is `"hapi-cli"` or `"aidbox"` depending on `--backend`. `"validator_version"` is present only for `hapi-cli` (extracted from HAPI CLI stderr). `"tx_mode"` and `"terminology_binding_validation"` are present only for `hapi-cli`; the latter only when `tx_mode` is `"local"`. `"ig_version"` and `"us_core_version"` are present only in the 1c-ii report. Both backends produce structurally identical reports.

---

## Feed Manifest (Client Deliverable — Engagement Kickoff)

The feed manifest is the ground truth for feed-level traceability. Collected before extract generation.

```json
{
  "plan_id": "[pseudonymized at delivery]",
  "extract_date": "2025-10-14",
  "us_core_version": "6.1.0",
  "fhir_version": "4.0.1",
  "feeds": [
    {
      "feed_id": "epic-prod-org447",
      "feed_type": "ehr-fhir-bulk",
      "source_system_name": "Epic EHR",
      "source_system_type": "clinical_ehr",
      "files": ["Patient.ndjson", "Condition.ndjson", "Observation.ndjson",
                "Encounter.ndjson", "Procedure.ndjson"],
      "member_count": 4823,
      "notes": "Epic MyChart FHIR R4 bulk export, org 447"
    },
    {
      "feed_id": "claims-edw-prod",
      "feed_type": "administrative-claims",
      "source_system_name": "Claims EDW",
      "source_system_type": "administrative_claims",
      "files": ["ExplanationOfBenefit.ndjson", "Coverage.ndjson"],
      "member_count": 9847
    },
    {
      "feed_id": "labcorp-hl7v2",
      "feed_type": "lab-fhir-transformed",
      "source_system_name": "LabCorp",
      "source_system_type": "clinical_lab",
      "files": ["Observation-lab.ndjson", "DiagnosticReport.ndjson"],
      "member_count": 3201,
      "notes": "HL7v2 ORU transformed to FHIR via Interbox"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Absence of feed manifest** = Level 6 governance finding (metadata management maturity score 1).
**Resources from undeclared sources** = undeclared source finding (data governance gap).

## Source-Type Inference Algorithm

Applied when feed manifest does not explicitly declare source-type for a resource and `meta.source` is absent. See `dqar-05-source-inference-algorithm.md` for full decision tree and Tier A/Tier B detectability framework.

| Immunization.primarySource = true or absent | `clinical_ehr` | high | EHR/PHR |
| Observation.category = vital-signs/exam/survey | `clinical_ehr` | high | EHR/PHR |
| Condition + SNOMED + verificationStatus=confirmed | `clinical_ehr` | medium | EHR/PHR |
| Condition + ICD-10 only, no verificationStatus | `administrative_claims` | medium | Administrative |

| Encounter + CPT + no participants | `administrative_encounter` | medium | Administrative |
| Topology cluster match | cluster-derived | low | per cluster |
| No signals | `unknown` | unknown | None → Tier 1 finding |

**Tier B types** (`clinical_phr`, `clinical_hie`, `clinical_registry`, `case_management`, `disease_management`, `pharmacy_specialty`) are structurally indistinguishable from `clinical_ehr` at Priorities 3–6. They require feed manifest or `meta.source` declaration. Resources falling to `unknown` because of absent Tier B declaration are Tier 1 metadata management governance findings.

## SQL on FHIR Assessment Queries — Minimum Viable Library

Five priority measures for UC1 MVP. Each measure has four query types: denominator context check, measurement period window check, exclusion code context check, data source attribution check.

### Infrastructure

```sql
-- HEDIS VSD lookup function (Aidbox PostgreSQL)
-- Requires VSD loaded via Sonian VSD loader
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION hedis_validate_code(
  p_code TEXT,
  p_system TEXT,
  p_value_set_oid TEXT
) RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM hedis_vsd
    WHERE code = p_code
    AND code_system = p_system
    AND value_set_oid = p_value_set_oid
    AND measurement_year = '2025'
  );
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

-- Measure attribution join function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_resource_provenance(p_resource_ref TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE (
  source_type TEXT,
  source_feed_id TEXT,
  ecds_ssor TEXT,
  pipeline_id TEXT,
  inference_confidence TEXT,
  ol_run_id TEXT,
  ingest_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
) AS $$

### Priority measure stubs

**CBP — Controlling Blood Pressure**
- Denominator: members 18-85 with hypertension diagnosis (value set OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.3.464.1003.104.12.1003)
- Level 3 checks: outpatient or telehealth encounter type (class AMB or VR), measurement period date window, blood pressure Observation linked to qualifying encounter
- Key failure mode: encounter type constraint — inpatient BP readings should not qualify denominator

**CDC — Comprehensive Diabetes Care**
- Multiple numerators: HbA1c testing, HbA1c control, eye exam, kidney health evaluation, blood pressure
- Level 3 checks: HbA1c LOINC code in correct value set, result value in physiological range (4-15%), result date within measurement period, performing lab linked
- Key failure mode: HbA1c LOINC cross-mapping errors (lab-specific local codes not mapped to standard LOINC)

**COL-E — Colorectal Cancer Screening ECDS**
- Denominator: members 45-75
- Level 3 checks: age constraint applied at measurement period end, exclusion codes in correct context (colorectal cancer diagnosis, colectomy), screening procedure in correct value set
- Key failure mode: exclusion code applied to wrong encounter type silently suppressing eligible members

**BCS-E — Breast Cancer Screening ECDS**
- Denominator: women 50-74
- Level 3 checks: sex/gender constraint, 24-month lookback window for mammography, exclusion for bilateral mastectomy
- Key failure mode: 24-month window not applied — 12-month window used instead, inflating apparent compliance

**FUH/FUM — Follow-Up After Hospitalization**
- Denominator: members discharged from inpatient psychiatric facility
- Level 3 checks: discharge date as anchor for follow-up window (7 days / 30 days), follow-up encounter type constraint (outpatient mental health), encounter sequence logic
- Key failure mode: discharge date vs. admit date confusion — wrong anchor shifts measurement window

## Technology Stack

### Client-side conformance testing kit (Stage 1, runs on plan infrastructure)

| Component | Rung 1–2 default | Rung 3+ upgrade | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bulk FHIR API conformance | stage1a_bulk_fhir_export_preflight (Python) | stage1a_bulk_fhir_export_preflight (same) | Live server test — no validator dependency |
| Extract packaging conformance (Stage 1a2) | stage1a2_bulk_fhir_extract_preflight (Python) | stage1a2_bulk_fhir_extract_preflight (same) | Library-only, no external dependency |
| ndjson validator (Stage 1b) | stage1b_ndjson_validator (Python) | stage1b_ndjson_validator (same) | No external dependency |
| FHIR R4 structural conformance testing | HAPI Validator CLI | Aidbox native conformance testing | HAPI: no vendor contract needed; `--tx-mode local` (default) or `live` |
| US Core 6.1.0 conformance | HAPI Validator CLI + US Core IG | Aidbox native validation | HAPI: runs anywhere Java available |
| Report output | One combined JSON + one combined HTML | One combined JSON + one combined HTML | No PDF rendering; orchestrate.py rolls up all substage JSON into a single report |

**Validator backend is a deliberate ladder design decision.** HAPI is the default because it requires no Health Samurai contract, no HIPAA review, no procurement — the client runs it on their own infrastructure with no external dependencies beyond a Java runtime. When the plan advances to Rung 3 and has Aidbox in production, the conformance testing backend switches to Aidbox native conformance testing, which provides richer error metadata, write-time conformance testing rather than post-hoc, and consistent behaviour between the client kit and the sandbox. The reports are structurally identical regardless of backend — the findings format does not change.

### Sonian sandbox (Stages 3–5, runs on Sonian/Health Samurai infrastructure)

| Component | Technology | Version |
|---|---|---|
| FHIR server | Aidbox (Health Samurai) | Current |
| Terminology server | Termbox (Health Samurai) | Current |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Aidbox-managed) | 14+ |
| FHIR validation (sandbox) | Aidbox native + HAPI CLI | Latest |
| US Core IG | hl7.fhir.us.core | 6.1.0 |
| SQL on FHIR | SQL on FHIR v2 ViewDefinition | HL7 spec |
| Anonymization | Python 3.11+ | — |
| Lineage tooling | OpenLineage / Marquez (optional) | — |

## Open Items — Confirm Before Build

1. **NCQA dQM license for SQL query derivation** — confirm whether building SQL on FHIR queries from Vol. 2 narrative specifications (Sonian-held license) requires separate authorization for consulting use, or whether deriving queries from dQM CQL packages requires a custom NCQA license. Path 2 (Vol. 2 derivation) is the safe default.

2. **Aidbox US Core 6.1.0 profile validation on write** — confirm with Health Samurai that Aidbox supports US Core 6.1.0 profile validation at write time (not just at query time). Confirm whether auto-Provenance generation on ingest is configurable.

3. **Termbox standalone licensing** — confirm with Health Samurai whether Termbox can be licensed independently of Aidbox for plans that already have a FHIR server. This affects UC3 (monitoring service) commercial model.

4. **Velox Health Metadata integration** — confirm Velox's specific capabilities for feed-level lineage documentation. Velox is a clinical data inventory and scoring platform (veloxhealthmetadata.com). Their 10-10-10 assessment process is complementary to DQAR. Explore referral/partner relationship.

5. **NCQA dQM Evaluation Package pricing** — contact NCQA Account Executive to confirm pricing and whether evaluation package covers consulting use of JSON value sets.
