# DQAR Framework Summary
**Digital Quality Audit Readiness — Indicina**
*Version: June 2026 | Confidential — Internal Reference*

---

## What DQAR Is

The Digital Quality Audit Readiness (DQAR) is Indicina's proprietary methodology for assessing health payer readiness for digital quality reporting. It replaces the manual, PSV-heavy HEDIS compliance audit paradigm with a FHIR-native, automated, standards-conformant, and semantically rigorous assessment framework.

**Indicina's position:** Indicina provides the validation services that health plans do not have the internal bandwidth to perform. Most plans have quality and analytics staff who understand HEDIS reporting — they do not have staff with the FHIR semantic validation, data lineage, and digital measure readiness expertise to assess their own pipelines rigorously. Indicina fills that gap.

Indicina does not pursue NCQA audit certification and does not act as a certified HEDIS auditor. The DQAR is a pre-audit readiness and digital transformation assessment service — the independent validation layer that sits upstream of the certified audit and upstream of the plan's own quality team.

**Remediation is the plan's choice.** The DQAR assessment produces findings. What the plan does with those findings is entirely up to them:
- **Internal staff** — the plan remediates using their own engineering and informatics teams. Indicina's findings report gives them the prioritized roadmap.
- **Indicina staff** — Indicina provides hands-on remediation advisory, implementation oversight, and validation of the fix. The $4K/month retainer covers this ongoing engagement.
- **Health Samurai staff** — where findings point to FHIR infrastructure gaps (Aidbox configuration, Termbox integration, Interbox pipeline instrumentation), Health Samurai provides the implementation. Indicina remains as independent validation that the remediation actually closes the finding.

This flexibility is a feature, not a gap. Plans at different maturity levels need different remediation paths. A plan with strong internal engineering needs only the findings and roadmap. A plan with no internal FHIR capability needs Indicina and Health Samurai to do the work. The assessment is the constant; the remediation path is the plan's decision.

## The Core Thesis

Most U.S. health payers have:
- A FHIR surface that passes structural conformance testing ✅
- A data lakehouse for claims analytics ✅
- **Nothing between those layers that validates whether clinical data feeding HEDIS measure execution actually means what the measure specification requires** ❌

This semantic validation gap is the primary locus of HEDIS audit failure and digital measure readiness risk.

### The Calibration Problem — Primary Marketing Pitch

> *"A one-week IS assessment with staff interviews and system demonstrations cannot assess this complexity. The audit was calibrated for a 500,000-member commercial plan with a claims system and a spreadsheet-based supplemental data process. It is not calibrated for a 5-million-member multi-product payer with a cloud data lakehouse, five upstream data vendors, and a FHIR API surface serving Prior Auth and payer-to-payer data exchange simultaneously."*

Condensed version:
> *"The audit was calibrated for a 500K-member plan with a claims system and spreadsheet supplemental data. It is not calibrated for a 5M-member payer with a cloud data lakehouse, five upstream vendors, and a FHIR API surface serving Prior Auth and payer-to-payer data exchange simultaneously."*

### The NCQA DCS Positioning — Secondary Marketing Pitch

> *"NCQA certifies that the measure logic is correct. NCQA's Digital Content Services explicitly does not validate your data mapping or accuracy. DQAR fills that gap — validating the five semantic layers between your raw payer data and your CQL engine, and assessing the MDM maturity, metadata management capability, and data governance policies that determine whether your data quality is sustainable across measurement periods. Without both, you have a precisely executed calculation on ungoverned inputs."*

**Source:** NCQA Digital Content Services Customer Handbook (April 2025): *"Successful Implementation confirms that Licensee successfully installed the Digital Content Services Application or Licensee Engine, and the Measures. It does not confirm the Licensee's data mapping, data accuracy or implementation of the NCQA FHIR IG."*

This is not a weakness in NCQA DCS — it is a deliberate scope boundary. NCQA is a measure standards body, not a data operations company. DQAR fills the upstream gap DCS explicitly does not cover.

---

## The Three-Tier Findings Structure

Every DQAR engagement produces findings organized into three tiers. This structure reflects Indicina's assessment scope — broader, more technical, and more forward-looking than a HEDIS compliance audit. A certified HEDIS auditor produces a compliance checklist against NCQA Vol. 5. DQAR produces a governance maturity assessment, a data quality analysis, and a digital readiness roadmap — three distinct outputs that together answer questions the NCQA audit was never designed to address.

| Tier | Name | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Governance gap | A failure in data governance capability — change control, MDM, metadata management, or data operations — that has produced or will produce measure rate impact. Root cause is organizational. | No change control process for value set bindings — retired codes active for two measurement periods undetected; ETL rule modified post-lock with no documented approval |
| 2 | Measure data gap | A data quality failure directly affecting measure rates now — wrong codes, wrong resources, wrong clinical context, broken lineage hop. Root cause is technical and correctable. | LOINC mapped incorrectly for HbA1c — CDC numerator members silently excluded; Encounter.type constraint missing — CBP denominator inflated |
| 3 | Digital readiness gap | A capability gap relative to MP2029 ECDS mandatory reporting or CMS-0057-F P2P requirements. Not failing today — will fail the MP2029 transition without remediation. | No AuditEvent logging on FHIR server; lineage graph terminates at lakehouse boundary; no provenance metadata on clinical resources |

**Tier 1 is the governance dimension.** A plan can fix a Tier 2 finding — patch the ETL rule, update the value set — and leave the Tier 1 governance failure untouched, producing the same class of error next measurement period. The three-tier structure forces both the technical problem and its governance root cause into every finding. That is what a CDO needs to remediate structurally, not just seasonally.

**Tier 3 is the competitive moat.** Invisible to the NCQA audit because that framework does not assess MP2029 readiness. A plan can pass their NCQA audit with a clean bill of health and carry a full slate of Tier 3 findings that will cause them to fail the MP2029 ECDS transition.

Every finding carries two dimensions regardless of tier:
- **Technical severity** — what is broken now and what is the measure rate impact
- **Governance root cause** — why it broke and whether the organization has the capability to prevent recurrence

## The Assessment Framework — Two Parallel Tracks

### Track A — Five-Level Semantic Validation (Technical)

Assesses what the data *is* right now. Point-in-time. Executable against a Bulk FHIR extract in the Aidbox assessment sandbox.

**Level 1 — Terminology conformance**
Is the code in the correct NCQA-published value set for the correct measurement period?
- Tool: Termbox + VSD conformance testing
- Answers: "is this code valid for this measure?"
- Does NOT answer: "is this code being used correctly in this clinical context?"

**Level 2 — Resource structural conformance**
Does the FHIR resource conform to US Core and QI Core profiles? Is the code in the right field?
- Tool: HAPI FHIR Validator
- Answers: "does this resource conform to the IG?"
- Does NOT answer: "does this resource represent the right clinical event for this measure?"

**Level 3 — Context conformance** (measure logic awareness required)
Is the resource type correct? Is the encounter type constraint enforced? Does the resource date fall within the measurement period?
- Tool: SQL on FHIR v2 ViewDefinition queries against Aidbox/Postgres
- Answers: "is this resource being used in the right clinical context for this measure?"
- Requires: knowledge of the HEDIS measure specification, not just the value set

**Level 4 — Clinical plausibility**
Does the data make physiological and logical sense?
- Tool: PIQI-style plausibility rules as SQL checks
- Checks: HbA1c values outside physiological range, encounter dates predating enrollment, diagnosis codes inconsistent with age or sex, lab results without performing organization
- Answers: "is this data clinically believable?"

**Level 5 — Population-level semantic coherence**
Is the distribution of codes across the population plausible? Are there systematic anomalies suggesting pipeline failures rather than clinical patterns?
- Tool: scikit-learn/PyOD anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, One-Class SVM)
- Checks: sudden code frequency spikes, zero clinical records from high-volume PCPs, implausible population-level distributions
- Note: requires sufficient population volume — most meaningful in continuous monitoring (UC3) rather than sample-based assessment (UC1/UC2)

**Important:** Terminology conformance (Level 1) alone does not constitute semantic validation. All five levels are required. A plan can have 100% VSD conformance and produce completely wrong measure rates if Levels 2–5 are broken.

---

### Track B — Level 6 Governance and Management Capability (Organizational)

Assesses whether the organization can *sustain* data quality over time. Assessed through structured interviews, documentation review, and artifact inspection — not executable against data. Uses a 1–4 maturity rubric.

**MDM Maturity**

Three master data domains directly affect HEDIS measure rates:

*Member MDM* — identity resolution across enrollment sources, retroactive disenrollment handling, product-line transitions. Failures corrupt denominator completeness. Assess: is there a governed member identity matching process connected to HEDIS eligible population logic? Are enrollment edge cases handled by a governed rule set or ad hoc?

*Provider MDM* — provider specialty, network status, TIN-to-NPI mapping, attribution logic. Failures corrupt provider-attributed denominators and clinical data completeness by provider. Assess: is the provider directory governed against NPPES? Is specialty mapping version-controlled?

*Terminology MDM* — SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm, NDC bindings governed at platform level or per-application? Is the VSD refresh an annual governed process with a documented owner and change control record?

**Metadata Management Maturity**

Does a data catalog exist (Collibra, Alation, dbt docs) covering HEDIS-relevant data assets? Does it reach the FHIR pipeline or only the BI/reporting layer?

Are transformation rules documented at field level? System-level descriptions ("claims flow from CAPS to EDW") are not field-level lineage ("diagnosis code in EDW.claim_line.diag_cd_1 sourced from CAPS.transaction.icd_diag_1, no transformation applied").

Is there a data dictionary mapping HEDIS data elements to source fields? Without this, semantic validation findings cannot be remediated — the plan doesn't know which upstream field to fix.

**Data Governance Policy Maturity**

Is there a data governance function — council, CDO, or equivalent — with authority over data quality standards across HEDIS-relevant systems? Or is quality governance fragmented by application owner?

Are there documented data quality SLAs for HEDIS-relevant data feeds? Vendor contractual obligations for conformant LOINC codes, latency SLAs for EHR feeds?

Is there a year-round change control process for ETL rules, value set bindings, and measure logic? Absence of post-lock change documentation reflects a deeper governance failure — the absence of year-round change governance. DQAR assesses the governance capability, not just the audit-season artifact.

**Maturity Rubric — DAMA-DMBOK Anchored, CMMI-DMM Structured**

The DQAR Level 6 maturity rubric uses the CMMI-DMM five-level progression as its structural backbone and is grounded in DAMA-DMBOK knowledge areas for data governance, MDM, metadata management, data quality, and data operations. It is calibrated specifically for payer HEDIS pipeline operations — not generic enterprise data management. This is Indicina proprietary IP with no licensing dependency on CMMI Institute (now merged with ISACA) or any other licensed framework.

DAMA-DMBOK provides the knowledge area taxonomy your CDO buyers already know. CMMI-DMM provides the maturity ladder structure. DQAR operationalizes both for the specific failure modes, tools, and regulatory deadlines of payer HEDIS operations.

Five DAMA-DMBOK knowledge areas assessed per engagement:

| CMMI-DMM Level | Plain language (DQAR) | Typical plan finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Initial | Ad hoc — no documented processes, tribal knowledge | Most plans at score 1 on metadata, many at 1 on MDM |
| 2 — Repeatable | Reactive — processes exist for some areas, not enterprise-governed | Common for governance where HEDIS team has processes but no CDO authority |
| 3 — Defined | Governed — documented, standardized, applied consistently across HEDIS pipeline | MP2029 readiness floor |
| 4 — Managed | Measured — quality metrics tracked, SLAs in place, vendor accountability | Where leading payers with strong CDO functions are |
| 5 — Optimizing | Continuous improvement — quality embedded in pipeline, automated monitoring | Future state — UC2 monitoring service enables this level |

Most plans assessed will score 1–2 across MDM and metadata, 2–3 on governance. Level 3 is the MP2029 readiness floor. The UC2 monitoring subscription tracks maturity progression toward Level 3 each quarter.

**Note:** DAMA-DMBOK reference slides will be uploaded to the DQAR Shared KB project to anchor rubric development. Do not author the detailed rubric until DAMA materials are available in the project KB.

## The Six DQAR Audit Domains

### Domain 1 — IS Assessment
Evaluates payer information system capabilities: system inventory, EDI transaction handling, FHIR server provenance, access controls, and change management. The NCQA IS Assessment accepts narrative descriptions and staff interviews. DQAR requires machine-readable artifacts — a materially higher and more defensible standard.

### Domain 2 — Value Set Conformance and Currency
Highest-yield domain. Most plans have stale value set bindings. Key procedures:
- VSD currency check against NCQA MP2025 (369 value sets, 179,831 codes, 15 code systems)
- NDC Medication List Directory currency
- SNOMED/LOINC/ICD-10 cross-mapping audit (Level 1–3 combined)
- Terminology drift detection (MP2024 → MP2025 retirements)

**VSD conformance template — three modes:**
- Mode 1: API reference — client's Termbox/FHIR terminology server, Indicina read-only scoped access
- Mode 2: Client-provided export — client's licensed VSD loaded to assessment sandbox, deleted at engagement close per SOW
- Mode 3: JSON value sets from client's dQM package — FHIR ValueSet resources included in licensed DCS package, loaded directly to Termbox; covers ECDS measures only; no Excel parsing required

**NCQA DCS JSON value sets:** For the 19 ECDS-eligible MP2025 measures, NCQA distributes value sets as JSON FHIR ValueSet resources within the dQM package. Pricing not publicly listed — contact NCQA Account Executive. The dQM Evaluation Package is likely the appropriate tier for assessment/testing purposes.

### Domain 3 — Data Lineage Tracing
For each HEDIS measure:
```
source field → transformation rule → intermediate table → analytic field → measure flag
```
Plans without dbt or equivalent lineage tooling cannot produce this documentation. Absence of traceable lineage is itself a material finding.

### Domain 4 — Semantic Validation
The highest unmet demand in the market. Corresponds to Levels 3–4 of the semantic validation framework. Key procedures:
- Code-in-context validation (encounter type constraints)
- Negation and exception code audit
- Clinical plausibility checks
- ECDS data source attribution verification

### Domain 5 — Population Completeness

**PIQI Framework integration:** Domain 5 is operationalized using the PIQI (Patient Information Quality Improvement) framework dimensions. PIQI is explicitly cited in the foundational DQAR article as a required framework for the next-generation audit. The four PIQI dimensions map directly to Domain 5 procedures:

- **Usability** -- 834 enrollment reconciliation. Is the full eligible population present in the FHIR pipeline? Gap between 834 member count and FHIR Patient/Coverage count is a PIQI usability failure.
- **Plausibility** -- Continuous enrollment logic audit. Enrollment periods, gaps, retroactive disenrollment, product-line transitions. Demographic constraint consistency (age, sex, product line) across resources.
- **Comparability** -- Clinical data completeness by provider. Contribution rate consistency across high-volume PCPs. A provider with high attribution and zero clinical records is a PIQI comparability failure -- systematic completeness gap affecting every ECDS measure denominator.
- **Stability** -- Population-level anomaly detection (Level 5). Unexpected shifts in denominator size, exclusion rate, attribution patterns, feed volume per source-feed-id. Implemented via scikit-learn/PyOD (Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, One-Class SVM). Apply per source-feed-id, not globally -- multi-vendor pipelines have different baselines per feed.

**PIQI limitations for DQAR:** Stability checks require per-feed baselines, not global baselines. Comparability checks require concept-level comparison via Termbox value set mapping where multiple code systems represent the same clinical concept across feeds.

### Domain 6 — ECDS and dQM Readiness
Forward-looking domain:
- CQL library version verification against NCQA-released packages
- Parallel hybrid/ECDS reconciliation
- FHIR pipeline completeness by measure
- Data source attribution for all ECDS measures

## AuditEvent Provenance Architecture

### The Minimum Viable Provenance Pattern
Extend the standard FHIR AuditEvent at ingest time with seven fields. Written once per resource, at write time, by the pipeline.

```json
"extension": [
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/source-type", "valueCode": "clinical_ehr" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/source-system-id", "valueString": "epic-prod-org-447" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/hedis-source-declaration", "valueCode": "ecds-ehr" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/ingest-pipeline-id", "valueString": "dqar-20251014-001/epic-prod-org-447/Condition.ndjson-chunk-003" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/source-feed-id", "valueString": "epic-prod-org-447" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/source-inference-confidence", "valueCode": "asserted" },
  { "url": "http://indicina.com/fhir/ext/ecds-ssor", "valueCode": "EHR/PHR" }
]
```

`hedis-source-declaration` (EXT 3) and `ecds-ssor` (EXT 7) are both derived from `source-type` via deterministic mapping rules defined in `dqar-05-source-inference-algorithm.md`. Full vocabulary: `ecds-ehr`, `ecds-administrative`, `ecds-lab`, `ecds-pharmacy`, `ecds-p2p`, `ecds-unknown`.

### Measure Attribution Join
```
member flag → resource ID → AuditEvent.entity.reference → hedis-source-declaration + source-system-id
```

### What AuditEvent Logging Is and Is Not
- ✅ Closes HIPAA audit control gap (45 CFR §164.312(b))
- ✅ Establishes FHIR server transaction log baseline
- ✅ Provides write-time source attribution for ingest pipeline resources
- ✅ Enables automated risk stratification by source feed — no manual inventory reconstruction
- ❌ Not a current CMS or NCQA mandate
- ❌ Does not automatically provide measure-level execution provenance
- ❌ Does not cover resources created outside the managed ingest pipeline

**Regulatory status:** No specific CMS or NCQA mandate requires AuditEvent logging today. Position as Digital Readiness Gap (Tier 3), not Governance Gap (Tier 1).

---

### Upstream Migration of AuditEvent Metadata — The Advisory Opportunity

The DQAR sandbox demonstrates AuditEvent metadata capture at Aidbox ingest time (Stage 3 of the UC1 pipeline). This is the starting point — not the end state.

**The advisory insight:** With Indicina guidance, and using the Aidbox AuditEvent ingest demo as proof of concept, plans can migrate the metadata capture point progressively upstream — from the Indicina sandbox to the plan's own FHIR infrastructure, and ultimately to the plan's FHIR vendor API bulk ingestion point. This means:

```
Stage 1 (demo / Rung 2):
  Indicina Aidbox sandbox captures AuditEvent metadata
  at anonymized extract load time
  → Proves the pattern, demonstrates the SQL risk stratification query

Stage 2 (Rung 3 — plan's own Aidbox):
  Plan's Aidbox instance captures AuditEvent metadata
  at production ingest time
  → Lineage metadata lives in the plan's own infrastructure
  → Risk stratification runs against production data, not a sandbox copy

Stage 3 (Rung 4 — upstream to FHIR vendor API):
  AuditEvent metadata captured at the plan's Bulk FHIR
  $export / ingest API boundary — the earliest possible point
  → Every resource tagged with source-system-id and source-type
    before it ever reaches the measure calculation layer
  → Lineage is native to the pipeline, not retrofitted
  → Upstream errors caught earliest — lowest remediation cost
```

The upstream migration path is an Indicina advisory deliverable — it is not something Health Samurai sells directly, and it is not something a plan's internal team can navigate without guidance on the AuditEvent extension pattern and the FHIR Bulk Data API interaction points. This is a concrete, multi-engagement advisory thread that grows naturally from the UC1 sandbox demonstration.

---

### Velox Metadata Integration — Data Source Inventory Push/Pull

The AuditEvent seven-extension metadata captured at ingest has a natural integration point with the Velox data source inventory. Velox's platform-side view of a plan's data sources is more useful when it reflects the actual per-feed resource counts, source types, and HEDIS source declarations that the AuditEvent metadata tracks.

**Two integration directions are viable:**

**Push — Aidbox → Velox:**
After each ingest run, a lightweight export of the AuditEvent metadata summary (per `source-system-id`: resource type counts, source type distribution, hedis-source-declaration breakdown) is pushed to the Velox data source inventory. Velox business users see a live, queryable inventory of what's in the FHIR pipeline — attributed by feed — without needing SQL access to Aidbox.

```
Aidbox AuditEvent metadata (per feed summary)
    → scheduled export job
        → Velox data source inventory API
            → Velox business user dashboard: "EHR feed epic-prod-org-447
               contributed 142,847 Condition resources tagged ecds-ehr
               last updated 2025-10-14"
```

**Pull — Velox → Aidbox:**
Velox's existing data source inventory (which the plan may already maintain for other purposes) is used to pre-populate the feed manifest at UC1 engagement kickoff. Rather than constructing the feed manifest from scratch via interviews, Indicina pulls the Velox inventory as the starting point and validates/enriches it against the AuditEvent metadata after ingest.

```
Velox data source inventory
    → feed manifest draft (Indicina kickoff)
        → validated and enriched by AuditEvent metadata post-ingest
            → gap between Velox inventory and actual AuditEvent feeds
              = undeclared source finding (Domain 1 / Domain 3)
```

**The partnership value:** This integration makes the Velox inventory self-correcting over time — it reflects what is actually flowing through the FHIR pipeline, not just what was documented in a spreadsheet during the last IS assessment. For Velox, this is a concrete differentiator: their data source inventory is live and pipeline-sourced, not static. For Indicina, the Velox inventory becomes a pre-populated starting point for every new engagement — reducing kickoff effort and surfacing undeclared sources faster.

**Confirm with Velox:** API availability for data source inventory write (push path) and read (pull path). Priority integration to propose in partnership discussions.

## Industry Dialogue — Semantic Validation

**LinkedIn exchange with Jeff Helman (AEGIS), June 2026:**

Michael E. Campbell: *"Clearly Layers 1 and 2 can be validated against base FHIR or IG schemas. Do you envision the same approach for 3 and 4 (i.e., the national or state agency or organization creates an IG specific to their requirements) for conformance validation? Is there a better way than making more IGs?"*

Jeff Helman response: AEGIS directly supports and validates all FHIR IGs named in the CMS-0057-F Final Rule. This confirms IG-based validation covers the regulatory compliance surface (Levels 1–2) but not the measure-specific semantic layer (Levels 3–5). The "better way than making more IGs" answer DQAR proposes: computable data quality rules implemented at multiple lineage checkpoints.

Michael E. Campbell follow-up: *"This is a critical opportunity to implement layered computable data quality validations on multiple points of the data lineage. In my opinion, an under-appreciated feature of open source standards like FHIR is that it establishes a shared but [truncated — retrieve full text]."*

## Industry Case Study — UCare Collapse (2025)

**Source:** John Hoff, MTR Group, LinkedIn, June 2026. "The UCare Collapse Was Fully Visible Before It Happened."

UCare (Minnesota) absorbed a ~20% enrollment increase of displaced UnitedHealthcare/Humana members during AEP 2024 network disruption. The receiving plan had inadequate risk data on the transitioning population. 2025 results: MA loss $263M, Medicaid loss $315M, total $504M. Reserves exhausted.

**Tom Shankle's observation (Healthcare Strategy and Operations):** If the CMS-0057-F Payer-to-Payer data exchange mandate had been in place in 2024, UCare would have received five years of clinical history on those transitioning members — potentially changing the risk assessment and avoiding the financial collapse.

**Michael E. Campbell's reply:** *"Any strategic advantage on payer to payer exchange depends on several data concerns. How complete is the payer data — most clinical data is left out of FHIR by default and most plans don't use FHIR data for analytics. It's still treated as a data source incompatible with legacy analytic platforms. A plan with FHIR native architecture, broad scope of included data, and SQL on FHIR or similar analytic environments can leverage that data while others leave it siloed."*

**DQAR implication for UC5:** The UCare case is the concrete financial consequence of P2P data quality failure. The data was theoretically available. The capability to assess and use it was not. UC5 (Payer-to-Payer Data Exchange Quality) addresses exactly this gap: assessing whether incoming P2P data is complete, semantically valid, and analytically usable — before it enters the risk and quality pipelines.

**Pitch for UC5:** *"UCare received an enrollment cascade they couldn't risk-assess because their analytics infrastructure couldn't leverage the clinical data that was theoretically available. A plan with FHIR-native architecture, governed P2P data quality assessment, and SQL on FHIR analytics turns that data into a competitive advantage. Without it, five years of clinical history on transitioning members sits siloed and unused while the losses accumulate."*

## The Incumbent HEDIS Vendor Trap — Strategic Competitive Context

This is one of the most important conversations in a DQAR engagement. Many plans are seriously considering staying with their existing HEDIS vendor — Inovalon, Cotiviti, Arcadia, or equivalent — rather than building toward FHIR-native infrastructure. The DQAR assessment creates a natural decision point, and Indicina must be prepared to make the case clearly.

### What Incumbents Are Offering Now

The major HEDIS ETL and measure reporting vendors have responded to the MP2029 ECDS mandate by adding digital quality reporting engines to their existing platforms. The pitch to plans is: *"You don't have to change anything. We'll handle the FHIR layer for you, just as we handled your ETL."*

This sounds low-risk. It is not.

### The Hidden Cost Structure of Staying

**1. ETL and MRR fees continue — possibly increase**

Plans using Inovalon, Cotiviti, or similar vendors pay for:
- Annual ETL customization to accommodate NCQA measurement period changes
- Measure rate reporting (MRR) production and submission services
- Medical record retrieval (MRR) coordination and chase workflows
- Chart abstraction and hybrid oversample management

These fees are typically $2–6M+ annually for a mid-sized MA or commercial plan. Adding a digital reporting engine on top does not replace this cost structure — it adds to it. The vendor gains a new revenue stream on the ECDS migration while the legacy services remain billable.

Critically: **each HEDIS measure run is a vendor-billed event.** Plans pay per run — for validation runs, parallel testing runs, remediation verification runs, and the final submission run. Running HEDIS measures internally against a plan-owned Aidbox instance with SQL on FHIR queries has no per-run cost beyond infrastructure. The per-run fee model is one of the most underappreciated cost drivers in the incumbent vendor relationship, and one of the clearest ROI arguments for the in-house path.

**2. Lineage visibility disappears at the vendor ETL handoff**

When a plan's data crosses into the HEDIS vendor's ETL pipeline, the plan loses visibility and control. Every transformation hop from that point forward — source normalization, code mapping, measure logic application, ISR/IDR production — happens inside the vendor's black box. The plan receives outputs. It does not receive lineage.

This means:
- The plan cannot trace a member's measure flag back to its originating source record through the vendor's transformations
- When a measure rate changes unexpectedly, the plan cannot determine whether the change originated in their source data or in the vendor's ETL logic
- The vendor's change control process is opaque — undocumented ETL changes after measure lock are a known audit risk that the plan cannot independently monitor
- DQAR Domain 3 (data lineage) findings are the plan's liability, but the evidence lives at the vendor

In contrast, the Indicina + Health Samurai architecture instruments lineage at every hop — from source system through Interbox integration through Aidbox ingest with AuditEvent metadata. The plan owns every lineage artifact. The risk stratification matrix is a query, not a vendor inquiry.

**3. CQL engine lock-in by stealth**

Incumbent vendors bundle their proprietary CQL execution engine with their digital reporting service. The plan's FHIR data becomes queryable only through that vendor's measure packages. When Medical Society measures arrive — or when the plan wants to run population health analytics beyond HEDIS — they have no pathway. The CQL engine the vendor controls becomes the bottleneck for every future quality use case.

**4. No independent auditability**

When the HEDIS vendor both produces the data and runs the measure calculation, there is no independent verification layer. NCQA DCS explicitly disclaims data mapping validation. The vendor's quality engine certifies itself. This is the same structural conflict of interest that exists in the certified auditor relationship — the plan has no independent view of whether their measure rates are defensible.

### What In-House FHIR with Indicina + Health Samurai Provides Instead

| Dimension | Incumbent HEDIS vendor | Indicina + Health Samurai path |
|---|---|---|
| FHIR infrastructure ownership | Vendor-hosted, plan has limited access | Plan-owned or plan-controlled Aidbox instance |
| ETL costs | Annual recurring, often opaque pricing | One-time implementation, plan-controlled thereafter |
| Per-HEDIS-run cost | Billed per run — validation, parallel testing, remediation, submission all cost | No per-run cost against plan-owned infrastructure |
| Measure reporting | Vendor produces ISR/IDR | Plan runs SQL on FHIR queries; Indicina validates |
| Data lineage visibility | Terminates at vendor ETL handoff — plan cannot trace beyond that boundary | End-to-end lineage from source system through Aidbox ingest; AuditEvent metadata at every hop |
| Lineage traceability point | Downstream of vendor ETL — too late for early error detection | Moves upstream to plan's own FHIR API bulk ingestion point with Indicina advisory |
| CQL engine | Vendor-proprietary, locked | Engine-agnostic; plan points data at any FHIR-capable CQL runtime |
| Data governance | Vendor-managed, plan visibility limited | Plan-owned; Indicina assesses and advises governance maturity |
| Independent validation | None — vendor validates itself | DQAR assessment provides independent semantic validation layer |
| Medical Society measures | Dependent on vendor roadmap | Plan can adopt any new CQL measure package independently |
| Long-term cost trajectory | Increases with measure complexity and run volume | Decreases as plan matures toward in-house capability |
| P2P exchange readiness | Vendor handles ingest — quality unknown | UC3 assessment validates incoming data before it enters the pipeline |

### The DQAR Assessment as a Migration Decision Tool

The DQAR UC1 assessment is structured to produce exactly the evidence a CDO needs to make this build-vs-buy decision:

- **Tier 3 findings** (Digital Readiness Gaps) document what the current vendor's FHIR implementation is missing — AuditEvent logging, US Core conformance, provenance metadata. These findings quantify the governance debt the plan is accumulating by staying.
- **Level 6 governance assessment** documents where plan-side capability currently sits. If the plan has no internal FHIR engineering capability, the roadmap names what must be built and in what sequence.
- **The remediation roadmap** provides a sequenced migration path away from incumbent vendor dependency, timed against MP2029 milestones and the Jan 1, 2027 P2P deadline.

**The pitch to a plan considering staying with Inovalon or Cotiviti:**

*"Your vendor is offering to manage your FHIR migration — which means your FHIR infrastructure, your data governance, and your CQL engine will live at the vendor, not at your plan. You will pay ETL fees and MRR fees and now a digital reporting fee, and you will have less visibility into your own data than you have today. A DQAR assessment costs a fraction of one year's vendor fees and tells you exactly what you need to build to own your own pipeline. The Health Samurai implementation that follows is a one-time investment in infrastructure you control. At $4K/month for ongoing advisory, you replace a multimillion-dollar annual vendor dependency with a cost-effective alternative that gives you more control, better reporting, higher QA efficiency, and a platform that can handle Medical Society measures, P2P exchange quality, and anything else that arrives after MP2029."*

### Target Replacement Path

The DQAR assessment creates a qualified target implementation path:

```
Current state:    Inovalon / Cotiviti ETL + MRR + (new) digital reporting engine
                      ↓  UC1 assessment identifies gaps and migration requirements
Transition:       Aidbox (Health Samurai) as plan-controlled FHIR server
                  Termbox for value set governance
                  Interbox for HL7v2/C-CDA integration pipeline
                  Velox for business user quality dashboard (plan-side)
                  Indicina for ongoing assessment objectivity and advisory
                      ↓  UC2 monitoring subscription through the migration
Target state:     Plan-owned FHIR infrastructure
                  Engine-agnostic CQL measure execution
                  Independent DQAR validation layer
                  Full P2P exchange readiness (UC3)
                  Medical Society measure-ready
```

## CQL Engine Agnosticism and Medical Society Measures

### DQAR Is Measure-Framework Agnostic

The DQAR five-level semantic validation methodology applies to any CQL-based measure consuming FHIR data. The five levels — terminology conformance, structural conformance, context conformance, clinical plausibility, population completeness — are requirements of the data, not of any specific measure framework. HEDIS is the initial focus because it has the regulatory urgency and the largest financial stakes. The methodology generalizes to any quality measure that executes against a FHIR data store.

This is a significant long-term positioning statement: as Medical Society measures proliferate, Indicina is already positioned to assess readiness for them without framework-specific customization.

### The Medical Society Measure Landscape

The AMA, ACC (cardiology), ACS (oncology), ASN (nephrology), and other specialty societies are actively developing FHIR/CQL-based clinical quality measures outside the NCQA HEDIS framework. CMS is incorporating specialty society measures into value-based care contracts, and MA quality frameworks are likely to follow.

For payers, this creates a structural problem that the incumbent vendor model cannot solve:

- Each society publishes its own CQL library with its own value sets (typically through VSAC but with independent governance cycles)
- Profile constraints may differ from HEDIS QI Core profiles
- Measure update cadences do not align with the NCQA measurement period calendar
- Plans cannot wait for incumbent vendors to add support — competitive advantage accrues to plans that can adopt new measures early

### Engine-Agnostic Architecture Enables Multi-Measure Execution

A plan with a well-governed FHIR server (Aidbox or otherwise) can point their data at multiple CQL engines simultaneously:

```
FHIR Data Store (plan-owned Aidbox)
    ├── NCQA HEDIS dQMs      → NCQA-certified CQL engine or SQL on FHIR
    ├── ACC cardiology        → ACC CQL library → any FHIR-capable CQL runtime
    ├── ACS oncology          → ACS CQL library → same or different runtime
    ├── CMS value-based care  → CMS CQL packages → plan's preferred runtime
    └── Plan-custom measures  → plan-built SQL on FHIR ViewDefinitions
```

The FHIR server is the single source of truth. CQL engines are consumers. This decoupling is only possible when the plan owns the FHIR infrastructure — not when it lives at a HEDIS vendor.

**The DQAR implication:** The UC2 monitoring subscription naturally extends to cover Medical Society measure conformance as those libraries mature. The same five-level validation methodology applies — just pointed at different value sets and profile constraints. Termbox's hybrid terminology architecture (local resolver for custom/HEDIS value sets, delegation to VSAC/NLM for standard terminologies) handles the multi-framework value set governance problem natively.

### What Plans Should Ask Their HEDIS Vendor Right Now

A DQAR engagement arms the plan's CDO with the right questions:

1. *"When ACC publishes their cardiology CQL library, how quickly can we run it against our data? What does that cost?"*
2. *"Can we query our FHIR data directly with our own SQL tools, independent of your reporting engine?"*
3. *"What is your upgrade path when NCQA changes US Core profile requirements between MP2025 and MP2029?"*
4. *"Who owns the AuditEvent provenance metadata on our FHIR resources — us or you?"*
5. *"When the P2P exchange goes live in January, who validates that incoming data before it enters our pipeline?"*

No incumbent HEDIS vendor has satisfactory answers to all five. The DQAR assessment surfaces exactly these gaps and provides the roadmap to address them.

## Industry Pain Points (Strategic Context)

- Annual HEDIS reporting requires "redundant, idiosyncratic, annual hard coding" of measures and manual chart abstractions
- CAQH estimates shifting from manual to automated quality workflows could save payers and providers ~$20 billion annually
- Health plans choose and pay their own certified auditor — structural conflict of interest analogous to pre-Sarbanes-Oxley corporate auditing
- Plans eager for anything that makes their data defensible before an auditor arrives
- Direct public criticism of HEDIS auditors suppressed by regulatory stakes (star ratings, CMS bonuses)
- NCQA DCS explicitly disclaims data mapping and accuracy validation — the upstream gap is unowned and unaddressed in the current vendor landscape
- **Incumbent HEDIS vendors are adding digital reporting engines that reproduce vendor dependency in FHIR clothing — plans risk paying more for less control**
- **CQL engine lock-in by incumbent vendors blocks Medical Society measure adoption and limits analytics independence**
- **Plans without in-house FHIR infrastructure cannot independently validate their own measure rates or P2P exchange data quality**
